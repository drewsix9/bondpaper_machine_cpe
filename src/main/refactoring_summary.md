# Serial Communication Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

1. Created a centralized serial communication system:

   - Added `SerialComm.h` with static methods for standardized message sending
   - Implemented message structure for internal communication

2. Updated the CoinCounter module:

   - Removed direct Serial.print/println calls
   - Added flag-based status updates instead of direct serial communication
   - Replaced handleSerial() with processCommand() that returns boolean success
   - Added methods for tracking status updates and events

3. Updated main.ino:
   - Centralized all serial writing through SerialComm
   - Modified processSerialLine to use the new command processing approach
   - Added checks for module status updates in the main loop
   - Added event handling for various module states

## Benefits

1. **Improved Response Timing**: All serial communication is now centralized in main.ino, which should fix the delayed responses during API testing.

2. **Cleaner Module Code**: Modules no longer need to handle serial formatting and communication, making their code cleaner and more focused on their core functionality.

3. **Standardized Message Format**: All messages now follow a consistent format, making it easier to parse and process on the receiving side.

4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common message formatting code is now in one place rather than repeated across modules.

## Remaining Work

1. Update the other modules:

   - CoinSlotISR
   - RelayHopper
   - StepperMotor/PaperDispenser

2. Each module should be updated to:

   - Remove direct Serial writes
   - Add status/event flags similar to CoinCounter
   - Replace handleSerial with processCommand

3. Update main.ino to handle status updates and events from all modules

## Testing

To ensure the refactoring works correctly:

1. Test basic commands to ensure they still work
2. Test rapid command sequences to verify correct response order
3. Verify the system handles errors properly
4. Check that responses are timely and not delayed

## Usage Instructions

The system now centralizes all serial communication. When sending commands to modules:

1. The command is parsed in main.ino
2. The appropriate module's processCommand is called
3. The module updates its state and sets status/event flags
4. The main loop checks for these flags and sends the appropriate messages

This ensures that all serial communication happens in one place, providing consistent timing and format.
