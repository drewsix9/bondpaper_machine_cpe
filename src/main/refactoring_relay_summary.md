## Serial Communication Refactoring Summary

### Goal

Refactor the codebase to centralize all serial reading and writing in main.ino, removing direct serial access from module files.

### Completed Refactoring for RelayHopper Module

1. **RelayHopper.h Changes**:

   - Removed direct Serial methods (sendStatusJson, sendAckJson, sendErrorJson)
   - Added status tracking flags (hasStatusUpdate, statusUpdated)
   - Added methods to check and clear status flags
   - Added processCommand method to replace handleSerial

2. **RelayHopper.cpp Changes**:

   - Removed all Serial.print/println calls
   - Updated begin() method to set status flag instead of writing to Serial
   - Modified setRelay() to track state without direct serial output
   - Implemented processCommand() to handle commands without serial communication
   - Updated class to use status flags for tracking changes

3. **main.ino Updates**:

   - Updated processSerialLine() to use RelayHopper's processCommand()
   - Added status checking for RelayHopper in the main loop
   - Updated systemActive flag to include RelayHopper status
   - Enhanced system status JSON to include relay states
   - Updated legacy command processing to use the new approach

4. **SerialComm Updates**:
   - Added methods to send relay-specific messages in a consistent format
   - Centralized all serial communication through this utility class

### Impact

1. **Architecture**:

   - Modules now focus on core functionality without handling I/O
   - Clear separation between business logic and communication
   - Consistent messaging format enforced by central code

2. **Communication Pattern**:

   - Modules report state changes through flags
   - Main loop periodically checks all modules for updates
   - All serial messages are formatted and sent from main.ino

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Centralized error reporting with consistent format
   - Better validation in one place rather than scattered across modules

4. **Performance**:
   - More predictable timing with single point of serial access
   - Reduced potential for message collisions or partial sends

### Next Steps

1. Apply the same pattern to the PaperDispenser/StepperMotor module
2. Update any remaining modules following the established pattern
3. Comprehensive testing of all command paths
4. Optimization of message handling in main loop
