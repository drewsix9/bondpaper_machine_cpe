## Final Refactoring Summary and Next Steps

### Completed Refactoring

1. **CoinCounter Module**

   - Removed direct serial methods
   - Added status tracking flags
   - Added processCommand method
   - Updated main.ino to handle centralized communication

2. **CoinSlotISR Module**

   - Removed direct serial methods
   - Added status tracking flags
   - Added processCommand method
   - Updated main.ino to handle centralized communication

3. **RelayHopper Module**

   - Removed direct serial methods (sendStatusJson, sendAckJson, sendErrorJson)
   - Added status tracking flags
   - Added processCommand method
   - Updated main.ino to handle centralized communication

4. **SerialComm Utility**
   - Created a centralized system for all serial communication
   - Added methods for different message types for all modules
   - Implemented consistent JSON format for all messages

### Next Steps

1. **PaperDispenser Module Refactoring**

   - Use the paper_dispenser_refactoring_plan.md as a guide
   - Add status tracking flags
   - Replace direct Serial calls with flag setting
   - Add processCommand method
   - Update main.ino to handle PaperDispenser communication

2. **Update Main.ino's PaperDispenser Handling**

   - Replace paperDispenser.handleSerial() calls with processCommand()
   - Add status checking for PaperDispensers in the main loop
   - Send appropriate messages when flags are set

3. **Final Testing**

   - Test all commands with the new architecture
   - Verify that timing issues are resolved
   - Check that all modules are properly reporting status and events

4. **Optimization**
   - Consider batching status updates to reduce serial traffic
   - Review memory usage with the new architecture
   - Look for any remaining direct Serial access

### Benefits of Completed Refactoring

1. **Simplified Architecture**

   - Clear separation between business logic and communication
   - Consistent message format across all modules
   - Single source of truth for all serial communication

2. **Improved Maintainability**

   - Centralized error handling
   - Standard pattern for all modules
   - Easier to add new commands or message types

3. **Better Performance**
   - More predictable timing with single point of serial access
   - Reduced message collisions
   - Cleaner control flow

### Lessons Learned

1. Centralizing I/O operations improves code clarity and reduces issues
2. Using status flags provides a cleaner separation of concerns
3. Standard patterns across modules make maintenance easier
4. JSON message handling is more maintainable when centralized
